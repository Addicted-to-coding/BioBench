        <h2>What is BioinfoBench</h2>

        <h2>Where do the tasks come from?</h2>
        <p>BioinfoBench consists of two datasets, the public set and the private set. The public set comes from questions sourced from bioinformatics textbooks.
            The private set is composed of real world exam questions manually prepared by faculty.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="data">
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>The public set currently consists of 700 questions, from introduction to bioinformatics, biostatistics and genetics textbooks. The private set is under preparation. The public set will be made publically available once the paper is published.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="contribute">
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>If you have a task or dataset in mind, we ask that you first reach out to us (contact Varuni at vsarwal@g.ucla.edu) with a description of the task and the dataset.
             Task contributions undergo a review process for both correctness and ambiguity. 
            We will then work with you to incorporate the dataset into BioinfoBench. Datasets must contain atleaset 50 samples to be considered.
            Task contributors will be invited to co-author our paper.</p>

    <section id="contact">
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>BioinfoBench is a large scale collaboration. For questions or concerns, please contact Varuni Sarwal (vsarwal@g.ucla.edu).</p>
